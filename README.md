Customer Churn Prediction for Subscription-Based Service

📌 Overview

This project aims to predict customer churn for a subscription-based streaming service. Customer churn is a critical metric for businesses offering subscription services, as it impacts revenue and long-term customer engagement. By leveraging predictive analytics, businesses can anticipate churn risks and implement strategies to retain customers.

📂 Dataset Description

The dataset consists of anonymized customer subscription details and their interaction with the streaming service. It includes information on subscription plans, payment methods, viewing behavior, customer support interactions, and other relevant attributes.

📁 Files in the Dataset

train.csv - Training dataset with customer details and churn labels.

test.csv - Testing dataset without churn labels for model evaluation.

data_descriptions.csv - Description of dataset columns and their meanings.

🎯 Target Variable

Churn - Whether a customer has canceled their subscription (Yes/No).

🎯 Objective

The main objective of this project is to predict customer churn based on their subscription details, payment history, and engagement with the service. Identifying customers with a high risk of churn enables businesses to:

✅ Implement personalized retention strategies
✅ Optimize customer engagement and content recommendations
✅ Improve pricing and subscription plans
✅ Enhance customer support services

🚀 Use Cases

Churn Prediction Models - Identify high-risk customers likely to cancel subscriptions.

Retention Strategies - Develop targeted campaigns to retain at-risk customers.

Personalized Recommendations - Suggest relevant content to increase engagement.

Pricing Strategy Optimization - Adjust subscription plans based on customer behavior.

🛠 Next Steps

Data Preprocessing - Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical features.

Feature Engineering - Create new meaningful features to improve model performance.

Model Training & Evaluation - Implement Machine Learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, XGBoost) and Deep Learning models (LSTM) for better predictions.

Deployment & Monitoring - Deploy the model and continuously monitor its performance.

This project aims to leverage data-driven insights to enhance customer retention efforts and optimize subscription services. 📈🎬
